#### _Special Instructions for Setup_

For deployment on your local machine you will need to set a few variables. First, request free API keys from both Google Maps (https://cloud.google.com/console/google/maps-apis/overview) and Open Weather (https://openweathermap.org/price). Once you have those, place them into the "config.env" file and rename it as ".env". Finally, start up your MongoDB Daemon and you're ready to go! Note that if your MongoDB Daemon is running on a different port you will need to change that in the ".env" file.
